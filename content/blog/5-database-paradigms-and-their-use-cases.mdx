The database paradigms I will be covering in this blog are

1. Relational
2. Key-Value
3. Wide-Column
4. Document
5. Graph

# What are database paradigms?

storing data for applications and businesses is stored in databases. These are 6
of the most popular database types and their use cases.

1. Relational Databases Data is the modern world is highly relational and
   connected. Relational databases make that easier with connecting models. It
   typically contains rows and columns similar in a SQL formats but it will
   contain relations by storing primary keys as values. It is easily queried
   although with the data being highly relational write time is longer. Popular
   database examples of this type are PostgreSQL(my personal favorite), MySQL,
   Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database. This type of database is useful for
   general use and things like accounts, users, transactions, and the general
   data storage.

2. Key-Value Databases Key-Value databases excel in things such as speed. They
   store data quite like the name, in a giant key-value storage. The most
   popular key-value database, redis, is typically used for things like session
   storage. Its quite read and write time allows for it to have faster response
   time but since key-value databases are often meant for less secure data. Data
   that would have little impact when something goes wrong because Redis is
   stored in memory instead of hard drive. This is for faster performance.
   Popular examples of this database are Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, Oracle NoSQL
   DB. This type of database is most often used in parallel with relational
   databases. The key-value database will store things like sessions, cookies,
   jwt tokens, logging while the relational database will store the important
   things such as accounts, transactions, products.

3. Wide-Column Wide column databases takes key values and provides column
   connected values. This means the key will often have many values associated
   with it. This makes it easier and somewhat relational. Wide-Column is also
   schema-less and does not support JOINS. The query language for this database,
   cql(similar to sql), provides a standardized way to query data. Popular
   databases for this are HBASE and Cassandra. Wide-Column is best suited for
   high-write low-read operations and provides a decentralized way of data
   storage. This makes it easy to scale horizontally or vertically.

4. Document Document databases are another popular way of storing general
   purpose data. It is often structured as a giant JSON object. It is first in
   documents, then in collections, and then indexes. Document does not support
   JOINS and is schema-less allowing freedom. It does not have a query language
   is can only be somewhat relational in its data. The trade off for document
   databases is that it allows fast read time and high write time as updating
   data as the data is more complex. Popular database examples in this type are
   MongoDB, DocumentDB, Firebase. Document databases fail when data is highly
   relational such as users that have friends, that have followers, that have
   posts, that have likes etc.

5. Graph Graph databases is organized as nodes and relationships between them
   with edges. The most popular Graph Database is DGraph. Unlike relational
   databases accounts would be directly linked to likes on a post rather than
   the middleman relation of the post. This allows for faster queries but a
   slower write time.

# Summary

My personal favorite database is still PostgreSQL which is still the most
popular to this day although with new technologies emerging we are bound to see
better options that will reinvent the way we store data.
