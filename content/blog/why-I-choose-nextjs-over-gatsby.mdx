## What is NextJS and Gatsby?

NextJS and Gatsby are both React frameworks that support server-side-rendering
and static-site-generation. Both have big community's and around 10k forks on
GitHub.

## Search Engine Optimization

Search Engine Optimization or SEO is known as how well Google and other browsers
will show your site on searches. Create-React-App uses Client Side Rendering and
then browsers will not be able to see the vast majority of what your site is
about and then does not give it great SEO.

NextJS and Gatsby Solved this by introducing SSR or Server Side Rendering. This
means once your code is uploaded the server will generate the static HTML
templates and then serve those to the client. Once served the site will become
fully reactive with client side rendering.

## Community

The Gatsby Community has over 2000 plugins with officially supported and
recommended ones available at creation. This can increase productivity and
decrease the speed it takes to build a site. An important note about Gatsby is
that it uses GraphQL for Static files. This can be more confusing for beginners
but is efficient.

NextJS goes with a more officially supported plugins with official Image
optimization, Meta, Analytics, and Authentication. NextJS also has a official
hosting provider, Vercel which is intuitive and easy to use and has Built in
Module CSS bundling.

## Production

Both frameworks have similar routing, both with fast refresh and little baseline
configuration. They are both Open source and have large community support

NextJS is used by major companies such as Netflix, Twitch, Starbucks, Uber, Hulu
and GitHub. NextJS has a considerable amount of more jobs available compared to
Gatsby and is typically used more widely.

Gatsby is also used by major companies such as PayPal, Apollo, Spotify, IBM, and
Figma even though it is less than NextJS. Gatsby also has its own cloud platform
and its own CLI.

In Production Gatsby sites do have a major problem. with server side rendering
in sites that are massive in production such as 100k pages GraphQL queries take
a considerable amount of time and the Gatsby build time will take hours. This is
less of a problem with smaller sites but with sites with content frequently
updating Gatsby does not shine. However NextJS does not suffer from this issue
so it is the preferred framework among major companies.

## Conclusion

While Gatsby is great NextJS has an edge in the real world and is my preferred
framework. As it is officially supported by Vercel and is highly used for major
sites, it is the framework I would recommend for most sites. However there are
still scenarios where Gatsby can perform better that NextJS.
