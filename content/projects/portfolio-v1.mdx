# Portfolio V1

The first portfolio iteration.

## Stack

Technologies Used:

-   Typescript
-   Javascript
-   Create-React-App
-   CSS3
-   HTML

## Layout

The project was split in by homepage, sections, and images in the src folder.
The CSS for the project was located soley inside the App.css file, sice then I
have learned much better practices than a huge CSS file.

```py
/public
/src
    /home
    /images
    /sections
    App.css
    index.tsx
    react-app-env.d.ts
tsconfig.json
README.md
LICENSE
package.json
package-lock.json
```
